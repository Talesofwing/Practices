The `Decorator Pattern` involves wrapping an object layer by layer, allowing it to dynamically gain new functionality at runtime. For example, if a sword is fitted with three gems, it is essentially being given three additional layers of functionality. (However, this kind of implementation is not very common in modern game development.)
