> **Command** is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations

The purpose of the `Command Pattern` is to encapsulate a `request` as an object, thereby allowing different requests, queues, or logs to parameterize other objects. This pattern generally supports undoable operations.

In general, the `Invoker` does not create the `Command`; instead, the `Command` is created by the `Client(Command User)` and then passed to the `Invoker` for execution.

In this example:
- Invoker: `CommandManager`
- Client: `CommandUse`

It also supports `undo` and `redo` operations.
